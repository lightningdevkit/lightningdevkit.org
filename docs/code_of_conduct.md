# LDK Code of Conduct

The LDK community consitutes a public forum dedicated to the development of the Lightning Development Kit software, the Lightning protocol and any related module. While as a community we cannot generally
restrict the content of the speech expressed by a community contributor, we still enforce restrictions if they're content-neutral and if they meet a reasonable time, place or manner restriction of such expression.

As of version 0.0.1, the communication channels considered as part of the Lightning Development Kit public forum are: a) the community website ("lightningdevkit.org"), b) the Github repository ("lightningdevkit"), c)
the Twitter feed (@lightningdevkit), d) the Discord server ("Lightning Dev Kit"), e) the LDK Review Club website ("ldk.reviews").

As a type of expression which is not protected under this framework:
- false statement of facts
- commercial speech
- fighting words
- obscenity and pornography

As an additional concern on the protection , the LDK community aims to observe high standards of ethical FOSS behaviors among its contributors and prevents the constitution of conflict of interests.

We invite the community contributors to read the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct: https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics

### Ethical Responsibilites of the Code of Conduct Team

affected substantially by the outcome of the process.

## Harrasment Protection

The LDK community aims to protect its contributors against harassment committed by other contributors.

LDK harassment rules and enforcement process are always subject to the scrutinity test to respect community contributor free speech.

By essence, LDK contributors are proposing competing ideas and codes in the LDK public forum, as such any harrasment claim should be under scrutinity they do not consistute a conspiracy or a collusion to damage
the credebility of another LDK contributor, and as such constitutes a distorsion of the LDK public forum of ideas.
