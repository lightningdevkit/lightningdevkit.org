# Blockchain Data 

LDK provides a simple `block_connected`/`block_disconnected` API which you pass block headers and transaction information to. LDK also provides an API for getting information about transactions it wishes to be informed of, which is compatible with Electrum server requests/neutrino filtering/etc.
