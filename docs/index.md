<h3>Multi-Language Support</h3>

We support native API's including C, Swift & Java so you can build lightning applications in your preferred programming language. 

<!-- [Documentation →](./getting-started/) -->

<div class="feature">
<h3>Custom Persistent Storage</h3>

Our API's let you choose how to backup new channel state. This gives you multi-wallet device access and lets you save state locally, to the cloud or an alternative backup scheme.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Custom Block Data Sources</h3>

Use a local full node, an SPV node, or your own Electrum server with API access to source data about the blockchain  and feed it to the LDK for decision-making about whether to sign a state update.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Single Wallet</h3>

No need to create separate Bitcoin & Lightning wallets, forcing users to backup an additional recovery phrase. Instead, we let you define your own wallet and create one unified experience.
