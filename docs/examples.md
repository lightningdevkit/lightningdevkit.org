# Examples

### [Rust Sample Node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample)

The sample serves as a complete reference for constructing a Lightning node with
the LDK. This is a good starting point if you want a self-guided tour!

### [Java Sample Node](https://github.com/getlipa/ldk-sample-java)

This repository contains a sample implementation of LDK as the result of
following the steps described in
[Building a Node with LDK in Java](/tutorials/build_a_node_in_java/).

### [Swift Sample Node](https://github.com/arik-so/ldk-swift-sample)

This repository contains a sample implementation of LDK as the result of
following the steps described in
[Building a Node with LDK in Swift](/tutorials/build_a_node_in_swift/).

### [Kotlin Sample Node](https://github.com/BlueWallet/HelloLightning)

Kotlin based CLI lightning network server based on LDK. Provides HTTP-RPC
interface.

### [LDK + BDK Sample Node](https://github.com/johncantrell97/ldk-bdk-sample)

This library hopes to bridge the gap needed to implement a LDK-based lightning
client using a `bdk::Wallet`.

### [Rust node with sample Lightning Signer integration](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/lnrod/)

A Rust Lightning node implementation based on the LDK and the Lightning Signer
projects. Aims to be production ready at some point.
