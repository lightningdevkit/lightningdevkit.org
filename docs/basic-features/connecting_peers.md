## Connecting Peers

First things first, let's join the Lightning Network! Connections to other peers
are established with `PeerManager`. You'll need to know the pubkey and address
of another node that you want as a peer. Once the connection is established and
the handshake is complete, `PeerManager` will show the peer's pubkey in its list
of peers.

```rust
match lightning_net_tokio::connect_outbound(Arc::clone(&peer_manager), pubkey, address).await {
	Some(connection_closed_future) => {
		let mut connection_closed_future = Box::pin(connection_closed_future);
		loop {
			// Make sure the connection is still established.
			match futures::poll!(&mut connection_closed_future) {
				std::task::Poll::Ready(_) => {
					panic!("ERROR: Peer disconnected before handshake completed");
				}
				std::task::Poll::Pending => {}
			}

			// Wait for the handshake to complete.
			match peer_manager.get_peer_node_ids().iter().find(|id| **id == pubkey) {
				Some(_) => break,
				None => tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10)).await,
			}
		}
	}
	None => panic!("ERROR: Failed to connect to peer"),
}
```

	// Connect and wait for the handshake to complete.
	SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
	nio_peer_handler.connect(pubkey, address);

	// The peer's pubkey will be present in the list of peer ids.
	final PeerManager peer_manager = channel_manager_constructor.peer_manager;
	byte[][] peer_node_ids = peer_manager.get_peer_node_ids();
}
catch (java.io.IOException e) {
	// Handle failure to successfully connect to a peer.
}
