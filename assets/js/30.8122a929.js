So even if a node sends 100 channel updates, and the only mutated property is its base fee, there would be no need to send out any other unchanged properties.

This realization led us to notice that many properties were set to the same value across different channel updates, so we decided to measure what values occurred most frequently. Then, to reduce data overhead, we declare those most commonly occurring values as defaults at the start of every gossip snapshot. Any property whose value matches the default can be omitted from the snapshot if a channel update refers to a previously unknown channel. The only difficulty arising from that optimization is distinguishing whether a channel update is new or incremental. As it happens, the last remaining bit of the channel flags lends itself perfectly for this purpose. This way, when an update is new, a set property bit will indicate a deviation from the default specified at the beginning of the snapshot. Otherwise, that same bit, when set, would instead indicate a mutation.
